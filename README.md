# **Project Proposal: Analyzing Travel Habits Through Google Maps Data Extraction**

## **Project Title:**  
**"Insights into Personal Travel Habits Using Google Maps Data"**

---

## **Introduction and Motivation**  
I was pretty hesitiant about what topic to choose for this project at the beginning of the term. While I was going back home from school, I got stuck in traffic and I thought why not I analyze my travel habits. Google Maps provides historical data about an individualâ€™s travel patterns, such as visited locations, routes, and travel frequency through a feature called 'Timeline'. This project aims to use my Google Maps data to analyze and visualize my personal travel habits.

## **Objectives**  
1. Extract travel history data from Google Maps Timeline.  
2. Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.  
3. Analyze travel habits, including frequently visited locations, preferred routes, and modes of transportation.  
4. Visualize travel trends using charts, graphs.

## **Methodology**

### **Data Collection**  
- Download Google Maps Timeline data via Google Takeout.  
- Extract relevant data (e.g., timestamps, locations, modes of transportation).  

### **Data Preprocessing**  
- Clean and standardize raw data for analysis.  
- Handle missing or inconsistent entries.  

### **Analysis**  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Identify trends in travel frequency, locations, and timing.  
   - Quantify distances traveled, average speed and transportation preferences.  

2. **Machine Learning Integration:**  
   - Predict future travel habits, such as distance in each day.  

### **Visualization**  
- Use Matplotlib for creating detailed visualizations.  
- Map travel paths and hotspots.

### **Reporting and Insights**  
- Summarize findings in a detailed report with visual aids.  
- Offer actionable recommendations for optimizing travel habits.

## **Expected Outcomes**  
- A comprehensive understanding of personal travel habits.  
- Visualizations of spatial and temporal travel patterns.  
- Insights into transportation preferences and travel efficiencies.  
- Predictive models for future travel patterns.  
- A framework for others to analyze their travel data.

## **Tools and Technologies**  
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** json, pandas, datetime, google.colab, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy
- **Visualization Tools:**   matplotlib
- **Data Source:** Google Maps Timeline (via Google Takeout)

## **Challenges and Limitations**  
- Ensuring data privacy and security throughout the project.  
- Addressing gaps or inconsistencies in Google Maps Timeline data.  
- Potential limitations in incomplete and missing trip records.

## **Conclusion**  
By analyzing Google Maps data and integrating machine learning tools, this project aims to display travel patterns and provide actionable insights. The proposed methodology can be used as a framework to transform location data into meaningful narratives, to show the power of data science in everyday life.
